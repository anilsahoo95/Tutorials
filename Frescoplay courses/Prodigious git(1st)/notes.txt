Version control is a system which records 
changes made to a file so that a specific
version can be recalled later

Types of version control systems:-
local
Centralized- all files are present at a central
server.. ex-SVN
Distributed- all files are present in central
as well as local systems of all users

install git on ubuntu:-
sudo apt-get install git

git repo is a folder with .git file where all
the changes are tracked

remote- it is a server where project code is
present.. ex- github,gitlab

origin- it is a variable where git stores the
url of remote repository

git init-- adds .git folder and initializes
current folder to track changes

git add-- adds the changes to the staging area

git status- shows the status of staging area

git commit- will save all changes with unique
hash in git repo

git push- sends the changes to remote repo

git clone- to get all changes present in 
remote to local
