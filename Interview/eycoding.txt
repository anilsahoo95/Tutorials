Find count of pairs in an array such that
sum lies between two given numbers

ans. traverse through the list and store
the elemnt along with its count in a map
then run a for loop on array and check if
sum-elemt in array exists as key in map..
if it does add to a count variable.. 
also check if diffrence is the number
itself.. in that case decrement count by 1
Then
divide count variable by 2 n return

print num of letters that should be removed
to make string anagram

take a hashmap dn add all lettrs of first
string along with their count

now iterate through second hashmap n subtract
from count if lettr is found.. if not add
letter.. dn run a foreach loop n check
wherever count is not 0 add that to count

num of substring of words without repeating
characters

no. of substrings in a string is n*n+1 / 2
