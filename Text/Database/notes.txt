Employee table:-
 4 columns- id,name,dept,salary

sql query to display max salary in table

select max(salary) from employees

2.sql query to display employee name who
takes max salary

U can use nested salary in the above case
basically the above query would give the
max salary u coud write a query to get name
where salary= the above query which returns
max salary

3.display second highest salary in employee
table

mine:-
select name,salary from employee_crashers e inner join 
(select max(salary) maximum from (select salary from employee_crashers where salary 
!= (select max(salary) from employee_crashers)) a) b
on e.salary=b.maximum

actual:-
select max(salary) from employee_crashers where
 salary != (select max(salary)
 from employee_crashers)

4.display all the dept names along with the
num of employees working with it

mine:select dept,count(*) from 
employee_crashers group by dept

group by means group them up meaning same
values will belong to the 1 group i.e the
column by which u group by

so based on column values diffrent groups vl
be formed

there are some conditions that are linked to
group by

1. select can have only those columns by which
u group by.. ex if u group by name dn select
can have nly name.. it cant hv id

in select the nly thing u can use except the
group by column is an aggregate function

lyk sum,max,count,min,avg

One more condition is that u cannot use 
where along with group by.. if u want to use
a where lyk condition u will have to use
haing instead

5. write a query to display all the dept with
count less than 2

mine:
select dept,count(*) from employee_crashers 
group by dept having count(*) > 1

select Nth highest salary in a emp table

select id,name from emp e1 where n-1=(
select count(distinct salary) from
emp e2 where e2.salary>e1.salary)

The above query will use two tables.. one is
main table n other is replica of main table

for every row in first table it will compare
with rows of the next table to find the
count of number of secong table row values
which are more than first table row n will
print the record where n-1 matches the
count of second rows being more than first
rows

Functions:-
Functions in postgres are stored procedures
which execute the statements within it

A function starts with create bor replace
function fnname()
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION total()

next u need to mention return variable and
type

returns integer as $total$

then u declare the variables n der types dt
u would be using in ur function under declare
statement

declare
total integer

then we need to use begin keyword n dn mention
the sql queries to be executed.. into keyword
is used to store inside a variable

begin
select count(*) into total from table_name;

then u need to return total n dn end

return total;
end;
$total$ language plpgsql

select total() to use it

create a function that takes in a argument
and returns argument + 1

create or replace function inc(value integer)
return integer as $inc$
begin;
return value + 1;
end;
$inc$ language plpgsql

create function to get sum of two arguments

create or replace function(val1 integer,
val2 integer)
returns integer as $sum$
begin;
return val1+val2;
end;
$sum$ language plpgsql
