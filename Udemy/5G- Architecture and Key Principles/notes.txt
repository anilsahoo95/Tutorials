0G--- Mobile phone systems were introduced
in 1930's..push to talk telephone service

1G--- simultaneous talk feature.. 1980's..
Advanced mobile phone system
poor voice quality, poor battery life

1990's- 
2G-global system for mobile communicatio
ns specification was launched 
enabled new features lyk sms and picture msg

2.5G- allowed sending mails n web browsing

telecom generations are also usually known
by the RAN technology used to enable them

ex- 3G is also known as WCDMA and 4G is also
known as LTE

4G-- HD mobile telivison and gaming
provided broadband grade data rates

Why 5G:-

no. of subsribers worldwide has gone up to
8 billion
need a network to provide access to all these
people
also need for data among humans as well as
machines has also grown a lot

5G is a collection of technologies that enable
us the new benefits of higher speed data and
better coverage with same energy consumption
as before

4G mostly is used for mobile broadband

5G use cases can be classified into 4 catego
ries:-

1.Enhanced mobile broadband-- watching 4K and
8K videos.. watching VR and AR content
2.Fixed wireless access-- here opearaot can
place a device just outsyd d premised of 
a customer and he would be able to use this
as an ethernet or hotspot and access internet

3.Massive machine Type communications:-
machines lyk sensors which need to send low
amount of data at infrequent tyms bt for a 
longer tym

4.Ultra Reliable low latency communication-
ex robotic surgery where a doctor manages
a equipment for surgery.. here the network
has to be reliable so that there is no 
downtime.. also latency should be really low
