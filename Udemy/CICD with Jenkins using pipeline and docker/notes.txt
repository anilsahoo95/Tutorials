Build node js:-
npm install
npm test

package the app in docker to distribute
distribute the docker image

in jenkins manage logins and add nodejs plugin

create new job
freestyle project
scm- git url

add build -- execute shell-
global tool conf- add node js

use jenkins to build a project in local:-
under general tab there is an option use
custom workspace
specify location there

run whatever commands necessary to run the 
projects in windows batch commands

manage plugins and add cloudbean docker build
and publish

jenkins provides u a web UI to create jobs and
build them
but we may face a lot of issues due to this
we wont have any history for all the changes
that have been made in configuration
and also no record of who changed them
suppose we make a change n things go wrong
we have no way of reverting back

this can be solved by writing build jobs
in code and save in version control like git




provide node/npm path

npm i is equal to build
