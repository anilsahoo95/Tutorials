Build node js:-
npm install
npm test

package the app in docker to distribute
distribute the docker image

in jenkins manage logins and add nodejs plugin

create new job
freestyle project
scm- git url

add build -- execute shell-
global tool conf- add node js

use jenkins to build a project in local:-
under general tab there is an option use
custom workspace
specify location there

run whatever commands necessary to run the 
projects in windows batch commands

manage plugins and add cloudbean docker build
and publish

jenkins provides u a web UI to create jobs and
build them
but we may face a lot of issues due to this
we wont have any history for all the changes
that have been made in configuration
and also no record of who changed them
suppose we make a change n things go wrong
we have no way of reverting back

this can be solved by writing build jobs
in code and save in version control like git

provide node/npm path

npm i is equal to build

Jenkins Job DSL(Domain Specific language) is a
plugin used to define jobs in a programatic
way with minimal effort

U can describe jobs using a groovy based lang
groovy is a scripting lang for java platform

DSL makes it easier to manage jobs.
if u have few jobs u can use UI
bt becomes difficult wn num of jobs increases
so we can use DSL

install dsl using manage jenkins n manage plugin
create new item- freestyle project-
write the dsl file in a git repo n dn use d
git repo n in build step choose process job 
dsls

when u build dis a jenkins job will be created
with the config values that u mentioned in
groovy file

Jenkins Pipeline
allows u to write jenkins build steps in code
build steps alow u to comple.test n deploy code

this code to write build steps can be put in
version control

Pipeline is a type of job that is created
it can be created using jenkins UI as well as
job DSL
