why to use threads:-
responsiveness-- with a UI we want to contin
ously respond to user events

performance- is faster

what a single thread contains:-
stack is a region in memory where local varia
bles are stored n passed into functions

IR- contains address of next instruction to
ne executed

Context switching- switch between different
threads

in context switching we will have to load
memory related to a thread to CPU everytym
the thread is changes.. the cost of swiching
between thread of same process is less
compared to switch between threads of differe
nt processes.
