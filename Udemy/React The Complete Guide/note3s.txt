earlier when u clicked a link on a browser
a request was sent to a server and a html page
was sent in return. upon clicking any action
a request used to be sent n a html page was
returned.. this was changed when js was used
which runs on browser once page is loaded

React is a javascript library that helps us
build rich user interfaces

SECTION 9:-

in return of jsx u cannot return two or more 
html elements..they will have to be wrapped 
inside a root element.. wrapping inside a div
creates lots of unncessary divs

React Fragments are build in wrapper elements
that can be used to wrap several html elemnts
to be returned.. 

<React.Fragment>
<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
</React.Fragment>

Anothet shortcut for react fragment is
<>
</>

React portals help us in writing cleaner html
code

import {useRef} from React;

const inputRef=useRef();

<input ref={inputRef}/>

console.log(inputRef.current.value);

inputRef.current.value='';
