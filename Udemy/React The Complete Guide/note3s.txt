earlier when u clicked a link on a browser
a request was sent to a server and a html page
was sent in return. upon clicking any action
a request used to be sent n a html page was
returned.. this was changed when js was used
which runs on browser once page is loaded

React is a javascript library that helps us
build rich user interfaces
