BootStap is a Ui css framework
It gives us a lot of HTML/CSS templates to get
started with web development

Browser Compatible
Faster development
responsive

ways to use bootstrap:-
using cdn
download and use-if doing offline
package managers- npm

Live Server- a vs code extension that refresh
es the UI as soon as we change something in a
simple html file

Prettier is an extension that lets us format
code in vscode

Install prettier extension in vs code, then after u write
ur code press on control+shift+p and then choose format
document n dn configure n then prettier..

Create a folder and open it in vs code. create
a file hello.html and right click on it inside
vs code n choose start live server

Use bootstarp by using cdn in link rel
also need to add scripts- jquery,popper n
bootstrap js

only if u add bootstrap cdn to ur html file
bootstrap by defult assigns some classes to
html elements and styles them. ex if u have
a <h1> tag in html n u link bootstrap cdn
then bootstrap would by default add a class
to h1 tag n do some styling

diffrent heading levels(h1...h5) in html will 
have diffrent markups.

if u want a h5 to have font size of h1 u can
simply add class="h1"
ex <h5 class="h1"> hello </h1>

if u want a heading to have a bigger fontsize
than h1 then u can use class="display-1"(1-6
available in bootstrap)

ex <h1 class="display-1"> Hello </h1>

if u want to make a p tag more prominent u
can add the lead class. It would increase 
font size n weight of p
<p class="lead"> something </p>

<p class="text-monospace"> something </p>
gives p a monospace styling

<p class="font-weight-bold" > make text bold
without using strong tag

<p class="font-weight-normal"> change text to
normal if its styling is bold somewhere

<p class="font-italic" >
for text in italic style

Text transformation use classes text-lowercase
,text-uppercase and text-capitalize
<p class="text-lowercase"> make all the letters
in lowercase

<p class="text-uppercase> make all letters
in uppercase>

<p class="text-capitalize"> make first letter
of every word capital

suppose u want to align something to the ryt
u can use class="text-right"

class="footer" adds some styling to make someth
look like a footer

if there are multiple lines in a p n u want
it to display in a single line i.e display as
much letters as possible n dn ... u can use
the class "text-trucate"

the li tags inside a ul will by default contain
a bullet along with some padding, u can rmove
them by adding class list-unstyled to ul
<ul class="list-unstyled"

by defaultl tags are in a horizontal position
u can use class list-inline in ul and use 
list-inline-item in all the li tags

if u want a p content to be uniform on both
sides(left n ryt) of a page or justify it.
u can add a class text-justify to p tag

text align classes are text-right,text-left n
text-center

in bootstrap we have 4 screen sizes-
sm,lg,md and xl

for alignment on basis of screen sizes u can
add class like text-sm-left

sm- means on screens sm n above
md- on screens medium n above
lg- on larger screens

vertical alignment
u can have multiple text in a single line
by including the texts within a span tag

now to have different alignments for the span
tags we can use classes align-baseline,align-
top,align-bottom,align-middle

h1,div are block level elements that take up
the entire screen width whereas span is inline
element that takes up the width it requires 
only

if u want to make a block level element an
inline element we can use d-inline class
<h1 class="d-inline">

Normally two block level elements will be one
line after each other but by using d-inline
they would come in one line next to each other

d-block would make an inline elemet into a 
block level element

d-inline-block class is used to make an elemen
inline-block

d above stands for display

float-left,float-right are used to float 
elemts to left n ryt respectively

Responsive float by using float-sm-left

text align applies to the text in the contain
er whereas float applies to the container
itself

when u use float an elemt left n other elemet
ryt dn the middle space will be taken up by
other elemet which could affect styling and 
alignment a lot so u need to clear it

clearfix class is used for that

<div class="clearfic">
<button class="float-left">
<button class="float-right">

class="fixed-top" is going to fix an element
to the top of the page

class="sticky-top" is going to place the elmt
as normal bt wn the user scrolls till the elmt
then it is going to be fixed at the top

fixed-bootom class is also der

text-primary class to make text color blue
text-success -green
text-warning-yellow
text-danger- red
text-light-light gray
text-secondary
text-info
text-white
text-dark
text-black-50- half as dark as black color
text-white-50-

to change color of a tag <a class="text-primary"

To give background colors the keys would be
sme as above bt text would be replaced by bg
ex-bg-primary,bg-success

class="invisible" makes the elemt disappear

bootstrap also provides a lot of margin n
padding classes that u could use

class="mb-0" would be margin bottom is 0
mb-1,mb-2... are also present

mt-0,1,2,3,4 is a class which is used for margin top
ml-0 is for margin left
mr-0 is for margin ryt

for margin on both left n ryt we can use
mx-5
for margin on both top n bottom we can use
my-5 class

pb-0 for padding bottom
pr,pl,pt,px n py are also there

m-3 would be margin at all 4 top,bottom,ryt
,left
p-3 would be padding at all 4

w-25 class takes 25 % of the width of contain
er

h-25 class takes 25% of height of container

to put a border to an elemet use class="border"
class=brder-top,border-bottom,bottom-left,
botton-ryt r used for border onlt at that
specific corner

to give a color to a border use border-primary,
border-secondary,border-success etc classes
along with border class

to have border rounded at the edges use rounde
d class.
rounded-top,rounded-bottom,rounded-ryt,rounde
-left
rounded-circle would give the border as a 
circle

@media(max-width:768px){
body{

}
}

<button type="button">Submit </button>
class="btn" will add a lot of styling and make
the button look a lot better
if we want to change the color of button we
could use classes lyk btn-primary,btn-secondary
btn-success etc

if u have a button n u want it to look like
a link u can use btn-link class

u can also use the btn nd btn-color class on
a tags and on <input type="button,submit,reset"
. this will make them look like a button

btn-outline-color(pri,sec etc) would give the
button a good look upon hoverng

if u want icons within a button u could use
link fontawesome in link rel and
 use an i tag with a class within a button tag

To make the button look large u can use
btn-lg class
btn-sm for small button

btn-block would make the button take up the
whole width

active class is usd to make a button look a 
bit dark blue which is used in dynamic web
dev

disabled class is used on a button to make
the button non clickable

<div class=dropdown
<button class="btn dropdown-toggle data-togg
le="dropdown">
Dropdowns
</button>
<div class="dropdown-menu>
<a href="" class="dropdown-item ></a>
<a href="" class="dropdown-item ></a>
<a href="" class="dropdown-item ></a>
</div>
</div>

a container class moves everything within it
to the center.. adds margin and padding by
default

<nav class="navbar navbar-expand >
<div class="container">
<a class="navbar-brand" href=""> navbar </a>
<ul class="navbar-nav">
<l1 class="nav-item">
<a>
</l1>
<l1 class="nav-item">
<a>
</l1>
<l1 class="nav-item">
<a class="nav-link">
</l1>
<l1 class="nav-item">
<a>
</l1>
</ul>
</div></nav>

---to create a basic navbar(above)

<nav class="navbar navbar-expand >
<div class="container">
<a class="navbar-brand" href=""> navbar </a>
<ul class="navbar-nav">
<l1 class="nav-item">
<a>
</l1>
<l1 class="nav-item">
<a>
</l1>
<l1 class="nav-item">
<a class="nav-link">
</l1>
<l1 class="nav-item">
<a>
</l1>
</ul>
</div></nav>

List Groups are fancy unordered lists

add a class list-group to ul

add class list-group-item to each li element
that adds border n padding to each li

for a list of a href u could add list-group to
ul n list-group-item to each a tag.. u can 
add an active class to represent a specific
row is active which sets up a background

u could style a list item according to its
role bt adding class list-group-item-primary,
list-group-item-secondary

breadcrumb is a group of items which is like
a menu showing the links that can be used
to navigate through all the pages

technically breadcrumb is a ordered list of
items or li.. To add styling for breadcrumb
add class="breadcrumb" to ol n add class=
"breadcrumb-item" to each li in the ol

in case of form each input is basically repre
sented by a div containing a label n a input
tag

<div>
<label for="name" > Name </label>
<input type="text" id="name" />
</div>

to make it look good add a class form-group to
thr div and add a class form-control to each
input

to make a input field readonly just add a 
readonly attribute to the input control

for select also we can use the same classes
to make it look good.. use form-group in div
and use form-control in select tag

suppose u want to have an input option where
user would need to upload a file you would
use input type="file"

to make the above look good use a class form-
group on div n a class form-control-file on
the input tag

for submit button add a class btn btn-primary
to make it look good

bootstrap also provides classes for form
validation to look gud/bad

<div>
<label>
<input class="is-invalid">
<div class="invalid-feedback">
Password is not correct
</div>
</div>

upon clicking on submit u would like to show
a input as green or show it as red.. in order
to do the same just add a class= is-valid
or is-invalid accordingly

37:-
Do ! tab to generate a html document

create html file n add a styles.css file in 
link and add the bootstrap cdn above
and also put fontawesome cdn above

before body ending add a script tag
and on a year id put text as currentyear to
show copyright..

<script>
$("#year").text(new Date().getFullYear());

Social Looplab project:-

downloaded the zip so that u can see the ui
for refernce nt code nly UI..

now lets start with the navigation bar:-
<body>
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-dark
navbar-dark fixed-top">

add a nav tag n give navbar class to it
navbar-expand-sm for responsiveness
bg-dark for background to be dark
navbar-dark to complement the above
//without the above the 3 icons in mobile will not
show
fixed-top to stick the header to top while
scrolling

inside nav create a div with class container

inside div create a a tag with href as index.htm
l and class as navbar-brand.. n text as LoopLab

after a create a button with class navbar-
toggler.. give it a data-toggle attribute
with value as collapse and data-target="#navbar
Collapse"

inside button create a span with class as
navbar-toggler-icon.. This would give u the
3 line icon

after button create a div with class as collapse
n navbar-collapse.. the collapse is to ensure
that we do not see the div initially.. This is
because we are going for a mobile first webpage
n give it a id of navbarCollapse... this is
the id that we used for target in button

inside div create a ul with class navbar-nav
and ml-auto so that it comes towards the 
right side of page

inside ul create li with class nav-item n 
inside li create a tag with class nav-link

<li><a href="#home-head-section>Home </a></li>
create 3 more lyk above with explore,create and
Share texts

Open in browser n u would see basic navigation
bar is created.. there is no 3 line icon in
normal page.. maybe the above alreday handles
showing full nav in web n 3 icons in mobile..
need to check-- yup it handles

go to css:
body
{
background-color:#333; almost black
color: #fff, white
}

.navbar
{
border-bottom: #008ed6 3px solid;
opacity: 0.8.. need to learn
}

now we need to add a background image but if we
keep the image as it is it would be tough to
see the text on it so we would add a dark
overlay to the image

now coming to home sections after the nav
tags

create a header tag n give id as home-section

inside it have a div with class dark-overlay

inside div have another div with class home-inn
er and container

inside container grid now we would use grid
which would show left side in 8 n right side 
in 4. bt in mobile the left side would
disapper

<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-8 d-none d-lg-block">

now col-lg-8 means it will take up 8 colums 
in the grid.. d-none class will make it nt
display at all dn d-lg-block will make it
display nly on large screens

inside div create a h1 with class as display-4
and text as Build social media profile and
generate revenue

now we have to create 3 compo with each having
a tick icon n text in one line

after h1 create  a div with class d-flex
create a div inside with class p-4 and align-
self-start to start from starting

inside this div need to add checkmark from
fontawesome

so create a i tag with class fas, fa-check and
fa-2x for bigger icon

after p=4 create another div with class p-4
and align-self-end and give it a random 2-3
lines of text

create 2 more d-flex lyk the above

now for ryt hand side:-
create div with class col-lg-4

create a div with class card,bg-primary for
blue backgroung,text-centre,card-form

create div with class card-body which will add
padding n stuff

inside add h1 Sign Up Today </h1>
under that <p>please fill out form to register

add a form inside form add a div with class
form-group.. inside this add an input with
class form-control that would give it some
padding.. and form-control-lg for it to be a
large input placeholder= Username

create 3 more form group for email,password n
confirm password... change type to email
n password...

after all formgroups add an input of type n
value as submit n add class btn btn-outline-light
and btn-block so that it takes up entire width
of container

nw go to style.css:-

#home-section
{
background:url("../img/home.jpeg");
background-repeat:no-repeat; need to learn this
background-size:cover; to cover the whole area
background-attachement: fixed; need to check
min-height: 700px;
}

now text wont be clearly visible due to image
so 
#home-section .dark-overlay
{
position:absolute;
top:0;
left:0;
width:100%;
min-height:700px;
background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7).. 0.7 is opacity
}

now basically they are creating a div which 
takes full sapce of parent then covering it
with black background then making the black
a bit transparent so that image can also be
seen a bit..

#home-section .home-inner
{
padding-top:150px;
}

#home-section .card-form
{
opacity:0.8;// so that form is a bit transparent
}

need to check the size of image idle image size for
a website is 1920 width and 1080 hright
40
