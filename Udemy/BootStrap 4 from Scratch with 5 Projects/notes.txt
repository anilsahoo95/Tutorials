BootStap is a Ui css framework
It gives us a lot of HTML/CSS templates to get
started with web development

Browser Compatible
Faster development
responsive

ways to use bootstrap:-
using cdn
download and use-if doing offline
package managers- npm

Live Server- a vs code extension that refresh
es the UI as soon as we change something in a
simple html file

Prettier is an extension that lets us format
code in vscode

Create a folder and open it in vs code. create
a file hello.html and right click on it inside
vs code n choose start live server

Use bootstarp by using cdn in link rel
also need to add scripts- jquery,popper n
bootstrap js

only if u add bootstrap cdn to ur html file
bootstrap by defult assigns some classes to
html elements and styles them. ex if u have
a <h1> tag in html n u link bootstrap cdn
then bootstrap would by default add a class
to h1 tag n do some styling

diffrent heading levels(h1...h5) in html will 
have diffrent markups.

if u want a h5 to have font size of h1 u can
simply add class="h1"
ex <h5 class="h1"> hello </h1>

if u want a heading to have a bigger fontsize
than h1 then u can use class="display-1"(1-6
available in bootstrap)

ex <h1 class="display-1"> Hello </h1>

if u want to make a p tag more prominent u
can add the lead class. It would increase 
font size n weight of p
<p class="lead"> something </p>

<p class="text-monospace"> something </p>
gives p a monospace styling

<p class="font-weight-bold" > make text bold
without using strong tag

<p class="font-weight-normal"> change text to
normal if its styling is bold somewhere

<p class="font-italic" >
for text in italic style

Text transformation use classes text-lowercase
,text-uppercase and text-capitalize
<p class="text-lowercase"> make all the letters
in lowercase

<p class="text-uppercase> make all letters
in uppercase>

<p class="text-capitalize"> make first letter
of every word capital

suppose u want to align something to the ryt
u can use class="text-right"

class="footer" adds some styling to make someth
look like a footer

if there are multiple lines in a p n u want
it to display in a single line i.e display as
much letters as possible n dn ... u can use
the class "text-trucate"

the li tags inside a ul will by default contain
a bullet along with some padding, u can rmove
them by adding class list-unstyled to ul
<ul class="list-unstyled"

by defaultl tags are in a horizontal position
u can use class list-inline in ul and use 
list-inline-item in all the li tags

if u want a p content to be uniform on both
sides(left n ryt) of a page or justify it.
u can add a class text-justify to p tag

text align classes are text-right,text-left n
text-center

in bootstrap we have 4 screen sizes-
sm,lg,md and xl

for alignment on basis of screen sizes u can
add class like text-sm-left

sm- means on screens sm n above
md- on screens medium n above
lg- on larger screens

vertical alignment
u can have multiple text in a single line
by including the texts within a span tag

now to have different alignments for the span
tags we can use classes align-baseline,align-
top,align-bottom,align-middle

h1,div are block level elements that take up
the entire screen width whereas span is inline
element that takes up the width it requires 
only

if u want to make a block level element an
inline element we can use d-inline class
<h1 class="d-inline">

Normally two block level elements will be one
line after each other but by using d-inline
they would come in one line next to each other

d-block would make an inline elemet into a 
block level element

d-inline-block class is used to make an elemen
inline-block

d above stands for display

float-left,float-right are used to float 
elemts to left n ryt respectively

Responsive float by using float-sm-left

text align applies to the text in the contain
er whereas float applies to the container
itself

when u use float an elemt left n other elemet
ryt dn the middle space will be taken up by
other elemet which could affect styling and 
alignment a lot so u need to clear it

clearfix class is used for that

<div class="clearfic">
<button class="float-left">
<button class="float-right">

class="fixed-top" is going to fix an element
to the top of the page

class="sticky-top" is going to place the elmt
as normal bt wn the user scrolls till the elmt
then it is going to be fixed at the top

fixed-bootom class is also der

text-primary class to make text color blue
text-success -green
text-warning-yellow
text-danger- red
text-light-light gray
text-secondary
text-info
text-white
text-dark
text-black-50- half as dark as black color
text-white-50-

to change color of a tag <a class="text-primary"

To give background colors the keys would be
sme as above bt text would be replaced by bg
ex-bg-primary,bg-success

class="invisible" makes the elemt disappear

bootstrap also provides a lot of margin n
padding classes that u could use

class="mb-0" would be margin bottom is 0
mb-1,mb-2... are also present

mt-0,1,2,3,4 is a class which is used for margin top
ml-0 is for margin left
mr-0 is for margin ryt

for margin on both left n ryt we can use
mx-5
for margin on both top n bottom we can use
my-5 class

pb-0 for padding bottom
pr,pl,pt,px n py are also there

m-3 would be margin at all 4 top,bottom,ryt
,left
p-3 would be padding at all 4

w-25 class takes 25 % of the width of contain
er

h-25 class takes 25% of height of container

to put a border to an elemet use class="border"
class=brder-top,border-bottom,bottom-left,
botton-ryt r used for border onlt at that
specific corner

to give a color to a border use border-primary,
border-secondary,border-success etc classes
along with border class

to have border rounded at the edges use rounde
d class.
rounded-top,rounded-bottom,rounded-ryt,rounde
-left
rounded-circle would give the border as a 
circle

@media(max-width:768px){
body{

}
}

<button type="button">Submit </button>
class="btn" will add a lot of styling and make
the button look a lot better
if we want to change the color of button we
could use classes lyk btn-primary,btn-secondary
btn-success etc

if u have a button n u want it to look like
a link u can use btn-link class

u can also use the btn nd btn-color class on
a tags and on <input type="button,submit,reset"
. this will make them look like a button

btn-outline-color(pri,sec etc) would give the
button a good look upon hoverng

if u want icons within a button u could use
link fontawesome in link rel and
 use an i tag with a class within a button tag

To make the button look large u can use
btn-lg class
btn-sm for small button

btn-block would make the button take up the
whole width

active class is usd to make a button look a 
bit dark blue which is used in dynamic web
dev

disabled class is used on a button to make
the button non clickable

<div class=dropdown
<button class="btn dropdown-toggle data-togg
le="dropdown">
Dropdowns
</button>
<div class="dropdown-menu>
<a href="" class="dropdown-item ></a>
<a href="" class="dropdown-item ></a>
<a href="" class="dropdown-item ></a>
</div>
</div>

a container class moves everything within it
to the center.. adds margin and padding by
default

<nav class="navbar navbar-expand >
<div class="container">
<a class="navbar-brand" href=""> navbar </a>
<ul class="navbar-nav">
