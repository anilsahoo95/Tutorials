create a springboot project with no dependency
and in pom.xml change the packaging to pom as
this would be a parent module n nt a 
standalone application

put all dependencies under dependencyManagemen
t tags and all plugins under pluginManagement
tags

right click on the main project to create a
child module naming twittertokafkaservice

add twitter-strea, dependency

also add lombok

put scope of lombok as compile as it will
be used only during compiling

@PostConstruct
public init method()
{
// this is called only once after beans are
registered
}

@PostConstruct is called only once after the
beans are registered by springboot

A use case can be adding mock users to db
after bean registering

@PreDestroy..called once before spring removes
bean from application context

use case can be to release db resources



application initializer can be done in
different ways.. meaning do something once
app is on

one more way to initialize is to implement
CommandLine runner and then override the
run method

@ConfigurationProperties(prefix="")

Field Injection vs constructor injection

we are building a twitter to kafka service
which would stream data from twitter and push
it to a kafka topic

use twitter4j to consume twitter api easily

create twitter developer console n create an
account to obtain secret keys

add these in properties file in app

create a listener package n create a twitterLis
tener class

extend statusadapter n override onStatus method
n print status.getText to console

annotate class with @Component so that spring
loads it as bean

create interface called streamrunner which has
a start method with void returntype n throws
TwiterExcepttion
