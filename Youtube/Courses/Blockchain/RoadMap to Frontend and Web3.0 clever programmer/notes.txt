Web 1.0-- read only was there.. we had sites
lyk google and msn where we could serach
things and then read things present in inter
net..There was no pushing of data from the
user side..

web 2.0- FB,Insta,Twitter,youtube-- u can edit
,update and delete things on the internet

Web 3.0-- Ethereum-- u have verifiable
ownerships here..currently if u want to
transfer money from one country to another,
it takes a bit of time and also a charge is
levied but in crypto, it is available 24x7
and can be used to transfer bitcoins immedia
tely.. no middleman is involved here

web 3.0 is decentralization..

the ownership is by people.. ex till now wn
u save money in banks dn bank is the owner,
tomorrow if bank closes down dn all ur money
is gone but in case of blockchain u remain 
the owner and there is no bank in between.
the only way that web 3 can shut is if one
day all people decide that they won't use
net anymore

It will enable in a lot more transparency
ex u would be able to see all the transaction
that the governmnet in making

People will also start buying properties
using this in the future

To create nft's u need to learn solodity
but it is very complex and would take a
bot of tyme to learn so in the meantime u
could use thirdweb
