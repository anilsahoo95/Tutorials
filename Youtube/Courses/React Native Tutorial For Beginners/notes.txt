Reactjs is a java script library used for 
building user interfaces

Normally we build web apps with react bt react
does nt only work for web..

ReactDom.render is what adds the web propert
ies to react

raect native is a collection of special 
components which it then compiles into
native UI widgets for both android and
ios

in react for web u would use <div>
in andoid u wud use android.view
in ios u wud use UIView
in React native u will use <View>

react native internally compiles ur view
into native andoid/ios widgets lyk UIView

Ur code can be divided into 2 parts:-
1.Views
2.business code

React native only compiles ur views into
native widgets bt the business code remains
as it is in javascript

To create a react native app we have two
tools:-

1.React Native CLI-- doesnt give much.. U will
have to do a lot of things urself

2.Expo CLI-- abstracts a lot of complexities
by giving u wrapper components.. U lose a 
lot of control which u would have on the
react native code.. Using maps/camera
is pretty easy.. U can also switch back to
react native cli wn u want to

In case of expo, for development purpose
we need to install expo client on the device
we test on n we run our app easily.. we can
also create standalone apps with expo

expo.io is the site for expo

npm install expo-cli -g

To create a new react native project type:-
expo init my-react-native
choose balank
cd my-react-native

then do expo start to start ur project
It will open a port on ur system.. just
scan the qr code there with ur phn 

import React from 'react'
import {Text,View,Button} from 'react-native'

export default App=()=>
{
return(
<View >
<Text> Hi Anil </Text>
</View>
)


}

import React,{useState} from 'react'
import {Text,View,Button} from 'react-native'

export default App=()=>
{
const [output,setOutput]=useState("initial")
return(
<View >
<Text>{initial} </Text>
<Button title="Change Text" onPress={()=>
setOutput("Updated")}
</View>
)
}

In react native there is very little cross
styling of components..

Thre are very few pre built components that
are available to u

U can also see the app results in android
emulators
