REPL is used to run code on command line
use node enter to enter into REPL mode

run js file either in node cmd or vs code terminal

global variables are the ones which u can access
throughtout ur application
__dirname-path to current directory
__filrname- file name
process- gives info abt env where node is working

console.log(__dirname)
setInterval will run something periodically after
an interval
setinterval(()=>
{
console.log("hello world");
},1000);
node app(without js) is also enough to run the
program

Modules- encapsulated code, only sharing what we
want

node uses commonjs module under the hood. every file
is a module by itself. js does it for us..

console.log(module) will give u info about the 
current module including what all u r exporting

require(./modulepath)
start with ./ in case module in current path
../ to indicate other paths

export as u go:-
const i=[1,2,3,4]
module.exports.item=i;

Node js has a lot of built in modules provided:-
we dont need to install them
1.OS module
interact with OS and server

const os=require('os');
const user=os.userInfo()
console.log(user);
