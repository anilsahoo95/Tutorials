AI came into existence when humans started
thinking can computer think??

wn u play a game with computer that is AI

computer is stimulating a human effort

In AI we give a predefined rules n data to
the computer and the computer applies those
rules to the data n comes out with the
output

In case of ML which is a part of AI, rules
are set by the computer. we give it input
and output data and it tries to set a rule
which it applies to next input that we
give and try to figure out the output

Neural networks is a type of ML which has
to go through multiple layers to reach at
the output whereas ML has nly one input layer
to reach at the output

neural networks are not modelled on the brain

an ex-
below is the list of grades received by
students in midterm1,midterm2 and final

midterm1   midterm2  final
70         40         90
60         50         60
30         10         50

The problem here is to predict any of the
above colun when we have the other two
columns provided to us

In ML we have terms lyk features and label
features represent the inputs that we provide
and label refers to the output that we wish
to receive..

17.11

wn we feed features in to a model we get 
label

Diffrent types of machine learning:-
1.Supervised Learning-- wn u have both feautes
and labels in data u need to provide it to a
model and it comes us with a set of rules.
so next tym u would nly provide it with
features and it would appy those rules and
predict an output. most common type of
learning in use today

2.Unsupervised Learning:- here u only have
features or input and u want the model to
predict the output for u. ex suppose we have
a lot of data then we want the model to group
the diffrent data into various groups n next
tym wn we give a input it should be able 
to predict to which group the data would 
belong to

3.Reinforcement Learning:-we have an agent,
a environment n a reward.. a reward is given
to the agent upon moving correctly and
negative reward wn doing wrongly so it rememb
ers on doing what it gets what reward n dn
moves to get positive rewards

Tensorflow is an open soource platform which
provides us a lot of machine learning librari
es which u can use to create models without
going much deep into maths which is normally
required in machine learning

Tensorflow has two main components:-
1.Graphs-- wn we write any code in tensorflow
dn it creates a graph for us.. wn we mention
a variable in code dn that variable is added
to the graph. suppose we mention that one 
variable is the sum of two other variables
dn dat expression is maintained in the graph

2.Sessions--it allows us to execute the graph
in parts

For hands on u can use google collaboratory
which is a open source jupyter on cloud
U have to create a notebook n use it

it is called notebook cos nt nly u can put
codes bt also notes in there

in a notebook click on code+ and then u also
hv a run button to run ur code

print("hello")

def func(h):
    print(h)

func("hello")

in collboratory if u need to use any module
u can simply import it.. U wont have to insta
ll it first

To install tensorflow on ur local u can use
pip:-
pip install tensorflow

google collba has multiple version of tensorfl
ow available so nly in the case wn ur using
tensorflow in collba u hv to mention which
version u want to use

%tensorflow_version 2.x
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.version)

if u gt verison as 1.sm then u have to runtime
dn restart

Tensorflow consists of tensors.. each tensor
has a datatype n a shape

datatypes include float32,int32,string etc

U create a tensor using the following syntax:
tensorname=tf.Variable(value,datatype)

ex-
string=tf.Variable("hello",tf.string)
number=tf.Variable(32,tf.int32)

a scalar means one value n a vector means
more than one value or d

ranks or degree is the num of dimensions in
the tensor..
above ones are 0 degree tensors

an array which a single array is 1d tensor

an array of arrays is a multi dimension tensor

rank1_tensor=tf.Variable(['anil','sunil'],
tyf.string)

rank2_tensor=tf.Variable([['anil,sunil],[
tapan,nirmal]],tf.string)

find rank of a tensor using:-
tf.rank(tensorname);
numpy attribute would give the rank

shape is the number of elemnts in each dimens
ion

to get shape use tensorname.shape

types of tensors:-
variable
constant

only variable is mutable

with tf.Session() as sess:
   tensor.eval()

Core machine learning algorithms:-
there are a lot of algorithms.. below 4 are
the basic ones

1.Linear Regression:-
given a set of points if we could draw a 
straight line correlating the diffrent points
what is linear regression

In 2D a line is represented as y=mx+c,
where c is the y intercept i.e where the line
touches the y axis

m is the slope

In linear regression we fed up inputs into
the model where we think the datapoints are
correlated to each other linearly i.e for
a set a increase in one would mean increase
or descrease in another and that would be the
same for most of the datapoints

wn we feed this data the model tries to create
a best fit line and next tym we give a input
it uses that line to predict the output

numpy allows us to to operations on large
sets of arrays

pandas is used to analyse large sets of data
load them, cut off some columns etc

matplotlib is used to visualize data in forms
of charts and graphs

A very important part of machine learning is
data.. we sould have a good understanding
of exploring,cleaning and selection of
appropriate data

we will use a titanic dataset which contains
info of all the passengers on the ship

In titanic dataset we have info abt the 
passengers and if they survived and we will 
try to predict if a new passenger would 
have survived or not

U can check code from tensorflow website also

load data and store in a variable
dftrain=pd.read_csv("csv file");

dftrain.head() would give a minimal subset
of the data loaded from csv

to remove a specific column from our dataset
we could do dftrain.pop('columnanme')
