get user information from database using jpa.
get username.password and authority info from db using jpa
u basically want these details from db thats all
mysql-
use springsecurity--- for using db
create a user table with following properties:
id
username
password
roles
active

n insert one record

dependencies-
jpa
mysql
web
security

Create a controller n 3 api's /,/user,/admin

create a class n extend websecurityconfigureraapter

override authnticationmanager and httpsecurity configure

//	@Override
//	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
//		http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers("/").permitAll().antMatchers("/admin").hasRole("admin").antMatchers("/admin").hasRole("admin").and().httpBasic();
//	}

for jpa u have to create a service userDetails that taken 
in a user and returns user object
so u are telling sb wn u have a user use my service to 
get the details

U have to create an implementation of userdetails service 
and pass it to configure of authenticationmanagerbuilder

Create entity and repo

entity will have id,username,password,roles,active

There is a userdetailsservice which u have to implement 
meeaning create a class n implement userdetailsService 
interface
it has a method loaduserbyusername in which u have to 
return an implementation of userdeatils.. meaning create a 
class implementing the above inteface

it will have various methods like getusername,getpassword

all u have to do is pass data into these methods.. u can do 
it hardcoded or get the fields from db n pass them here.

n speing security will take care of the rest
