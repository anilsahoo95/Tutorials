css is used to style a html document

inline style--put style for a paticular
elemnt
<p style="color:blue"></p>

U can put all the styles inside a style tag
above as well

<style>
p
{
color:red;
}
</style>

style using a class prefix with . in style tab
.blue-text
{
color:blue
}

with class u can style multiple elemnts by g
iving them all the same class

change the font size using font-size property
font-size: 14px

change the font type of the element ex-italic
arial using font-family property

font-family:monospace

There are a lot of font families that u can
use ex google fonts

put the font api url in <link href=""/>

font-family:lobster,'Sans Serif'

Suppose the font-family u provided could nt
be loaded in client browser u can provide
an alternate font-family by adding comma n
dn font-family in above

width property can assign width to any html
elemnt lyk div,p,image

width:500 px

css borders have properties lyk style,color
n width

border-color:red;
border-width:5px;
border-style:solid;

border-radius can make the border edges a bit
more rounder
border-radius:10 px

border-radius:50 % would make a elemnt inside
a circular border

background-color is used to provide a backgro
und color to an element

Id can be used to style a single elemnt only
style using id put # before id

every html element is rectangle shaped with
padding being the space outside the elemnt
n marging being the space between elemnt n
the border

padding: 50 px

marging:20 px

U can specify margin n padding for each of the
sides separately using -left,-right,-top n
-bottom properties

U can specify all the above 4 sides properties
in a single line as well using clockwise 
notation which basically mean each enumber
would correspond to the side starting from
clockwise direction in the elemt n starts 
from top

ex- margin: 10 20 50 70
which would denote top,right,bottom n dn left

Attribute selector-- suppose u want to style
elemts using attributes of elemnts by putting
the attribute n its value inside square 
bracket

[type='radio']
{
margin:20px
}

px is an absolute unit whereas em n rem are
relative units

pdding: 1.5 em

body is an elemnt that is created eben if u
dnt specify that elemnt in ur code
U can check this by giving a style to body
elemnt without having defined body element
in ur code

cascading in css basically means that a style
applied to a parent elemt is inherited or
cascaded to the child elemnts within it

so styles given to body are alreday applied
to all the elemts 

wn u have an elemt that has multiple styles
applied to it through different selectors,
then there might be conflits.. css resolves
these conflicts by following a specific 
order

suppose u dnt want css to follow a order n u
want a style to apply for sure dn u can mark
it as important by giving !important after
the style

ex- color:red !important;

Hex codes are basically 6 digits which can
be used to reprsent 16 million colors

U can shothand the hex codes if they are
present in repeated set.. ex red color hex 
code is FF0000
here FF cn be replace by F,00 by 0
so just F00 would also work

css variables are used to give a value to a
variable n dn that variable can be used 
anywhre in the code

It starts with -- n can be defined under any
selector block bt can be used anywhere in the
file

ex --penguin-skin:grey

backgroung color:var(--penguin-skin)

some browsers may nt support css variables so
u should hv a fallback value

U should define css variables inside 
:root{} so that they can be accessed anywhere
in the document

@media (max-width:350 px ){
:root{

}
}

U can add a display:grid style to an elemnent
containing other elemnts and then we can
use css grid properties

<div class="container">
<div class="d1">1</div>
<div class="d2">2</div>
<div class="d3">3</div>
<div class="d4">4</div>
<div class="d5">5</div>
</div>

.container{
display:grid;
grid-template-columns:100 px 100px 100px'
// no of columns the grid is to be divided n
what size each column shoukd hv
grid-template-rows:50px 50px
grid-column-gap:20px
grid-row-gap:5px
