webpack basically takes ur multiple html,css
,jss and asset files and bundles them or
groups them into smaller folders ex all css
files in one folder,all js in 1, all html
in 1 n all assets in one..

It also manages dependencies for u so suppose
a current file to be used depends on other
files webpack makes sure to include the
other files above this current file..

if u open react app in chrome n dn go to
sources then u can see all js in one folder
that too in mimimum no.of files..

Bundling code into minimize the number of
files

Colt/webpack-demo-app... git repo for this
project

now coding is nt the main thing till now
just want to see how webpack minimizes the
code that we write..

create a html,js n css file n a assets folder
to contain an image and create a UI that
takes in two numbers n add them and shows
in a textbox.. also show a image in UI from
the assets folder.. js file may have upto
40-50 lines of code..

just divide the js file u created into multip
le files so that we can see bundling in
action..normal syntax as we used in node.js

npm init -y to get package.json

npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

remove everything inside scripts in package
.json

and add "start":"webpack"

nw wn u do npm start webpack would run n will
give a error as by default if we dont give
anything it will look for index.js inside src
for it's entrypoint

create a index.js file inside src folder
and write console.log there n run npm start
it would work

a new folder dist would be created and a main.
js file would be created

22.19

now webpack is just bundling index.js
