wireframe is a visual representation of how
a project will work..It basically shows all
the web pages that are going to be involved
in the overall project

Thre is a app called concepts in apple which
can be used to draw sketches

First thing in designing is creating a sitemap
which contains the various pages that you
will build in the UI and which page would
come under which page

First page will always be a homepage

and for example you can have a contact us,
about us and features page inside the home
page

Now we can start to have a wireframe for
home page.. it will consist of a header and
a footer

Header would be divided into two parts:-
a logo n a menu

we can have a backgroung image for header
upon which menu would be present

Next we could have a about us section in the
home page

next we can have sponsors section

next we can have a footer which can contain
a contact form on left, sitemap in middle
and logo and phn and email in teh right

In wireframe ur basically reprsenting the
various elemnts you can think of initially
in the page and label them

Labelling should be a different color from
the reactangles u have done

Next we will have a features page where
the header will be same as home page

The nect section can maintain the page
title

the next section can contain the list of
features mentioned one by one with each 
containing an image,title, a bit of descrip
tion and a link to go to that page

Footer u can again copy paste from home
page

In wireframe u can draw lines or arrows
between pages to indicate the flow

Contact Us page can contain header,footer
and in middle phn,email and a map that can
show the location of the office
