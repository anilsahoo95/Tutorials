Injenkins mention repo url.. if the repo is
privae need to mention credentials as well

in build step add maven commands

clean install package

install tomcat.. dn inside conf u will have
server.xml where u can change the port 
u want ur app to run on

U can install tomcat on ubuntu and then
directly deploy from jenkins to that tomcat
server

u need to add deploy to container plugin
in jenkins to achieve that

To add credentials go to credentials on the
left hand side the jenkins and then global
credentials dn add credentials

in tomcat-users.xml create a user and give
him password and role manager-script

after install deloy to container plugin
in jenkins u will gt a option deploy war/ear
to container in build step of jenkins

wn u build in jenkins the result is stored
inside workspace directory

in war path u can give the absolute path

in tomcat url provide ip:port
